Project A: Generate 3D Objects
To draw a Multi-purpose Vehicle with some windmills. This vehicle can be
used as a crane to pull the heavy things. This vehicle can also be used as a
tractor.What’s more,you can see the beautiful windmills when you press some keys
to make the canopy away, which means rainbows come after the storm and people

you. You will see some windmills behind the canopy. This means that when the
rainbows come after the storm. After the canopy went away, you will see the
beautiful windmills. Then you can click the ++ccw button at the bottom of the web
to change the speed of all the rotations in this model .You can click the —ccw
button at the bottom of the web to change the speed of all the rotations in this. You
can press “left arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move left. You can
also press “right arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move right. You
can also press “up arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move up. You
can also press “down arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move
down.What’s more, drag the mouse in the canvas to rotate the objects.Click the
mouse in the canvas to move the objects in a certain direction.You can also tap-in a
