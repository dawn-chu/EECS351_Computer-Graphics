## Project A: Generate 3D Objects
**[View It Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/weihanchu/3DSpace_EECS351/blob/master/WeihanChu_ProjA.html)** <br/>
  To draw a Multi-purpose Vehicle with some windmills. This vehicle can be used as a crane to pull the heavy things. This vehicle can also be used as a tractor.What’s more,you can see the beautiful windmills when you press some keys to make the canopy away, which means rainbows come after the storm and people will get reward after your hardworking.


## Project B: Explore 3D Space

  Your mission in Project B is to fill the Canonical View Volume (CVV) of WebGL with the view seen by a 3D camera that users fly like an airplane, free to turn, dive, climb and go anywhere to explore a gigantic 3D ‘virtual world’. Your program will automatically re-size its 3D graphics to fill the full width of your browser window, to show two re-sized camera views side-by-side, with an orthographic view on the right, and perspective view on the left. The 3D world you explore will have patterned, grid-like ‘floor’ plane that stretches out to the horizon in the x,y directions. Arranged on this vast floor, you will place several animated, jointed solid objects (not wireframe) that you can explore by ‘flying’ around, between and behind them. Each vertex of each object must include its own individually-specified surface normal attributes, and these enable your shaders to compute a very basic overhead-lighting effect for diffuse/Lambertian materials.<br/>

## Project C: Lighting & Materials
**[View It Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/weihanchu/3DSpace_EECS351/blob/master/Weihanchu_ProjC.html)** <br/>
  My goal is to draw some 3D objects with good lights and materials. There is a ground plane surface below all the objects. And you can control the camera to move back, forward, left, right, up, down to see the objects from different angles. What’s more, you can also change the lighting method and shading method. The objects will be very beautiful.
