## Project A: Generate 3D Objects
  To draw a Multi-purpose Vehicle with some windmills. This vehicle can be used as a crane to pull the heavy things. This vehicle can also be used as a tractor.What’s more,you can see the beautiful windmills when you press some keys to make the canopy away, which means rainbows come after the storm and people will get reward after your hardworking.


## Project B: Explore 3D Space
**[View It Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/weihanchu/3DSpace_EECS351/blob/master/Weihanchu_ProjB.html)** <br/>
  My goal is to draw some 3D objects with the ground-plane grid. There are a robot in this project that have arms and legs which can move automatically. There is also a small car which can move automatically by its tires. On the other side, there is also a caterpillar with severals joints that can stretch out and draw back his body. One cylinder and rectangular are put on the ground that users can simply rotate it by move the mouse. Overall, it is a beautiful multi-objects scene.<br/>
  At first, you can press any key except “up arrow”, “down arrow”, “right arrow”, “left arrow” to make the canopy away, which will open a new world for you. You will see some windmills behind the canopy. This means that when the rainbows come after the storm. After the canopy went away, you will see the beautiful windmills. Then you can click the ++ccw button at the bottom of the web to change the speed of all the rotations in this model .You can click the —ccw button at the bottom of the web to change the speed of all the rotations in this. You can press “left arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move left. You can also press “right arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move right. You can also press “up arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move up. You can also press “down arrow” on the keyboard to make all the objects move down.What’s more, drag the mouse in the canvas to rotate the objects.Click the mouse in the canvas to move the objects in a certain direction.You can also tap-in a current angle to submit. You can also click the run/stop button to run/stop the model.
